title: Project Management at GSEA

To help with its push to have a balloon launch by the end of the calendar year,
GSEA is enlisting some new project management tools.  <!--END_EXCERPT-->
The first is a Gantt chart, which lists all the tasks remaining for the
project. Each task may have to wait until others are complete, and each task
has an estimated time.  The Gantt chart organizes and presents this information
clearly, and allows the team to see which tasks have the biggest effect on the
project's overall timeline--and so which ones should have the most resources.

GSEA is also using an N<sup>2</sup> diagram, which helps visualize the
interfaces between various system components, and a Failure Mode and Effects
Analysis (FMEA), which identifies key points of failure, their causes and
effects, and likelihood of occuring.  Both of these tools help inform the
creation of checklists and the final Flight Plan.
