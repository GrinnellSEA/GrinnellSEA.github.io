GSEA is well along the way to having a completed design for its Transcendence balloon.
<!--END_EXCERPT-->

Eight parts have been ordered already, with four more pending approval.  So far, the project is under budget.   The casing, packaging, and power subsystem team has finished their conceptual design and is finalizing part details before moving on to its Design Review.  The sensors and data subsystem team has done extensive research and has decided on a camera to use.  The software team has written draft code for most of the sensors and for the radio communication.

Each subsystem team is documenting their work and decisions in a design document, as part of GSEA's initiative to follow industry design practices.  Each team will undergo multiple reviews during the design and build process to catch issues before they become a problem.
