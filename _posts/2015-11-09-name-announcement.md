GSEA is pleased to announce that the name of the near-space balloon project
will be _**Transcendence**_.  

The name was selected in two stages.  The public first submitted ideas for the
name.  The team members then chose the top five names, which were put on a
final online ballot and voted on over a week.  

More information about the project itself can be found on its [mission
page](/missions/nearspaceballoon).
