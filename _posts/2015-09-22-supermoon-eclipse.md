# {{ page.title }}

This Sundday, September 29, we will have the opportunity to see a rare combination of a supermoon and a total lunar eclipse.  Join the GSEA on Mac Field to watch this event, which won't happen for another 18 years, at 9:00 PM.  This will also be an opportunity to learn more about GSEA and the current Near-Space Balloon Project.
