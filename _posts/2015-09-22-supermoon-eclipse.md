# {{ page.title }}

This Sunday, September 29, we will have the opportunity to see a rare combination of a supermoon and a total lunar eclipse.  Join the GSEA on Mac Field at 9 PM to watch this event, which won't happen for another 18 years.  This will also be an opportunity to learn more about GSEA and the current Near-Space Balloon Project.
