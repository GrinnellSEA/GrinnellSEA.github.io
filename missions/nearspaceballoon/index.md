Transcendence is a 1-2 lb probe that will be attached to a weather
balloon and flown to a height of 100,000 ft.  The probe will take pictures and
video as well as record temperature and pressure data along the way.
Transcendence will also get its position and altitude from GPS satellites.  It
will broadcast its location, along with its other sensor data, to the ground,
where a human team will receive it and track the probe's progress.
