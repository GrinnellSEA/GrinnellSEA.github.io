## Background

<img alt="logo" src="/assets/logo_256.png" align="right" height="128">

The Grinnell Space Exploration Agency, or GSEA, is a student organization of
[Grinnell College](http://www.grinnell.edu), a small liberal-arts college in
Grinnell, Iowa.  It was founded in 2015 with the goal of providing students
with an opportunity to learn about science and technology, explore space, and
collaborate with each other.  These three pillars of the organization—learning,
exploration, and collaboration—drive everything we do.

## Missions

GSEA is currently working on one mission, the Near-Space Balloon Project.
Learn more about it on its [mission page](/missions/nearspaceballoon.html).

## Software and Code

All code created by the GSEA for its missions is open-source and available [on
Github](http://www.github.com/GrinnellSEA/).
